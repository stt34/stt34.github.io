    <h2>BMW Bluetooth Audio Adapter</h2>

    <h3>Project Concept</h3>
    <p>My project car (a 2010 BMW 128i) did not come with many features that are standard to new cars. Thus, I was forced to use AUX for audio input. I found this cumbersome as I could not charge my phone and play music from it at the same time. Wireless charging was cumbersome and inefficient with a phone mount. In addition, most bluetooth audio retrofits for old cars used FM radio to transmit audio to the car, which seemed lackluster. Thus, I proposed a Bluetooth audio adapter that uses the car’s low‑amperage USB and outputs sound through aux.</p>

    <br>
    <h3>Project Timeline</h3>
    <p><strong>Initial Concept (June 13):</strong> Proposed a charging cable that had a bluetooth module piggybacking on it.</p>
    <p><strong>Pivotal Shift (June 20):</strong> Switched to a CSR8635 Bluetooth receiver powered by the USB port, opting to use the cigarette lighter for phone charging.</p>
    <p><strong>Prototyping &amp; Sourcing (June 27 – July 2):</strong> Cut a USB‑A→C cable for power, mounted the MakerHawk CSR8635 board on a breadboard, and placed 10 µF + 0.22 µF capacitors in parallel with the battery +/- pads for hiss reduction. I powered the board using its built in micro-USB connector</p>
    <p><strong>Noise Elimination (July 3 – 5):</strong> Opted to use the battery power +/- pads with a USB A pigtail, finally eliminating low‑volume hiss.</p>
    <p><strong>Packaging &amp; Installation (July 6 – 8):</strong> Tucked all components inside the center console, secured the board with double-sided tape for easy removal, resoldered and heat-shrinked connections, and routed USB and 3.5 mm cables through openings in the center console.</p>
    <p><strong>Validation (July 9 – 10):</strong> Confirmed plug‑and‑play pairing, stable audio under vibration, and proper power consumption under the constraints of the 1 A USB port in the car.</p>

    <h3>Roadblocks &amp; Successes</h3>
    <h4>Roadblocks</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Persistent hiss until capacitors were properly put in parallel with the power source by using the battery +/- terminals to power the board.</li>
      <li>Multiple connector attempts (butt splices, terminal blocks) failed under space and wire length constraints before adopting solder and heat-shrink.</li>
      <li>Always-on nature of the board caused parasitic drain of the car battery, which was remedied by a dongle that allows ON/OFF toggling of a USB port.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Successes</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Seamless Bluetooth audio streaming without poor or choppy connection.</li>
      <li>Simultaneous low power audio playback from a single port.</li>
      <li>Effective unpleasant noise reduction via proper capacitor placement.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>ECE Skills Gained</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Through-hole Soldering &amp; prototype assembly.</li>
      <li>Noise filtering: decoupling capacitor strategy.</li>
      <li>Real-world fabrication and integration: power budgeting, troubleshooting, and vibration-proof mounting.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
    <p>This project combined my passion for automotive tech with hands-on ECE practice. It reinforced my problem-solving through hands-on, custom hardware solutions that required me to troubleshoot without documentation. Next, I plan to add an enclosure that protects the device from water and dust. Completing this adapter has deepened my interest in embedded automotive systems, motivating me to explore over-the-air firmware updates.</p>
